1 of 2 University of Washington CSE 403: Software Engineering Reading Summary Description and Sample Reading Summary Each summary should contain the following: •a topic sentence that states the name, author, and chapter(s)/section(s) (if applicable) of the reading •a paragraph containing the main idea and several of the most important points from the reading (be specific!  cite specific examples or ideas used in the paper) •a paragraph of your own analysis of the paper (Does the author present valid points?  Do you agree with the paper?  What criticisms do you have, or what changes would you make?  How does this material relate to what has been covered so far in class?) The summary should be typed.  It should occupy no more than one page (expected length: approximately 1/2 to 2/3  page).    Assume  that  the  reader  of  your  summary is  a  competent  computer  scientist  who  has not  read  the article before. Summaries will not be accepted late.  The summaries will be graded on the following four-point scale: 4: </p> </br>


<p name="p2"> All main concepts and skills mastered and all major questions answered, with only minor errors. 3:   Important points made, but contains some significant omissions or errors. 2:   Substantial missing concepts or errors. 1:   Effort shown, but not a significant amount of relevant or correct content. 0:   Not turned in, or almost no effort or understanding demonstrated. Sample Summary: The following document could be turned in as a reading summary for this course: Billy Jones (bjones@cs.washington.edu), CSE 403, Winter 2048 (Instructor: Smith) Reading Summary #1 In  "Rules  about  Copying  and  Sharing  Java  Code,"  author  Josh  Smith  believes  that  code  copied  from others  should  be  cited  as  such,  otherwise  it  is  plagiarism.    Another  important  idea  that  Smith  discusses  is  that most discussions of plagiarism are with respect to "works in written and spoken language", and hence he wants to discuss how to cite the work of others within computer programs.  He supports this latter idea by specifying that  "due  credit"  is  given  to  others  by  specifying the  original  author,  the  source  where  the  code  was obtained, and  any  alterations  that  the  current  author  is  making  to  the  original  code.    The  author  provides  examples citations whose source is from a textbook, an instructor, the Internet, from multiple sources, and from code that is "common knowledge" in order to show how one can always clearly identify the author of each code unit in a variety of situations.  Another important point made by Smith is that code should never be transferred between students electronically, because this would imply unsuitable sharing of work and plagiarism. Smith's  target  audience  is  computer  science  students,  as  it  is  likely  that  either  they  are  unaware  of plagiarism  in  general,  or  they  are  aware  of  plagiarism  in  other  fields  but  have  not  considered  how  it applies specifically when writing  code. </p2></br>


<p name="p3">  This material relates to the  current course material because it  comes after the design process and during the implementation process, when the most code is being written and would be most available  for  potential  copying.    Smith's  guidelines  for  copying  and  reusing  code  are  accurate  and  useful; however, he forgets that sometimes a great deal can be learned by examining code written by others.  It would have been nice if he had left some provision where it was okay to do this under the right circumstances. 
2 of 2 Summary Grading Notes: The following are common errors students mistake in writing their summaries that can lead to score deductions: 1)Meta-summarizing the paper without going into detail ("MS"): "After  briefly  introducing  the  topic,  the  author  describes  the  pros  and  cons  of  various  approaches  to project management." Like what? 2)Regurgitation without showing evidence of deeper understanding ("REG"): "And then the author says... and then... and then..." 3)Excessive quotation ("QUOT"): You aren't required to back up all your claims with quotes.  A few are okay, but you don't need to back up every statement with a lengthy quote.  In fact, you often shouldn't. 4)Bad  balance  of  specific  and  general

</br>
<p id="p4"> ("DETAIL"):  e.g.  If  the  paper  is  about  lifecycle  models,  writing great  detail  about  only  a  few  models,  but  ignoring the  rest;  or  only  discussing  general  principles  of model application. 5)Vague critical analysis ("CRIT"): "In general I thought it was pretty good. Sometimes certain statements were a little unclear, but it didn't really detract from the argument he made.  ...." Why was it pretty good?  What was unclear?  What argument did he make? 6)Criticism with no supporting evidence or logical backing, etc. ("RANT"): "The  study  of  this  kind  of  thing  is  just  a  waste  of  time.  Every  argument  boils  down  to  obvious  projecttraits and downright common sense." "This class is stupid!" </p></br>
